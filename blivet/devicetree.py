            Hiding a device will cancel all actions that involve the device and
            will remove the device from the device list.

            If the device is not a leaf device, all devices that depend on it
            will be hidden leaves-first until the device is a leaf device.

            If a device exists, performs some special actions and places
            it on a list of hidden devices.

            Mixes recursion and side effects, most significantly in the code
            that removes all the actions. However, this code is a null op
            in every case except the first base case that is reached,
            where all actions are removed. This means that when a device
            is removed explicitly in this function by means of a direct call to
            _removeDevices it is guaranteed that all actions have already
            been canceled.

            If a device does not exist then it must have been removed by the
            cancelation of all the actions, so it does not need to be removed
            explicitly.

            Most devices are considered leaf devices if they have no children,
            however, some devices must satisfy more stringent requirements.
            _removeDevice() will raise an exception if the device it is
            removing is not a leaf device. hide() guarantees that any
            device that it removes will have no children, but it does not
            guarantee that the more stringent requirements will be enforced.
            Therefore, _removeDevice() is invoked with the force parameter
            set to True, to skip the isleaf check.
