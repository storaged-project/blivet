Deduplication and compression can be now enabled or disabled on
existing LVM VDO volumes.

Test suite improvements
------------------------
The blivet test suite has been split into two separate test suites:
unit tests that don't require root privileges and don't use real
storage devices and "storage" tests that use either loop devices or
virtual scsi devices for testing.

3.0.0
======
* `Python 2&3 Compatibility`_
* `Configuration Actions`_
* `Streamlined DeviceFactory Reconfiguration`_
* `New Upstream Location`_
* `DeviceFactory Defaults to LVM`_
* `DBus Interface`_
* `HBA RAID Info`_
* `DiskDevice.wwn`_
* `Removed`_
** `udev.device_is_realdisk`
* `Moved`_
** `Encrypted Volume Data`

Python 2&3 Compatibility
-------------------------
Blivet can now run using python-2.7.x or python-3.5.x. The ``six`` python
module is used as a compatibility layer.

Configuration Actions
----------------------
Setting arbitrary attributes of devices and their formatting can now be
accomplished using configuration actions (``ActionConfigureDevice``,
``ActionConfigureFormat``). Previously, the only way to do this was by making
ad-hoc changes that were not properly accounted for.

Streamlined DeviceFactory Reconfiguration
------------------------------------------
When passing a device to a ``DeviceFactory`` constructor to reconfigure that
device, blivet will now obtain the factory defaults from that device. This
saves the caller from having to pass all arguments explicitly to maintain the
initial settings for that device.

New Upstream Location
----------------------
Blivet has moved to https://github.com/storaged-project/blivet, along with
libblockdev, libbytesize, and blivet-gui.

DeviceFactory Defaults to LVM
------------------------------
``Blivet.factory_device`` and ``devicefactory.get_device_factory`` both
default to configuring LVM. Previously there was no default type.

DBus Interface
---------------
An *experimental* DBus interface has been added. It contains functionality
related to examining the current configuration, removing devices, and
configuring new devices using blivet's ``DeviceFactory``.

HBA RAID Info
--------------
Blivet now uses libstoragemgmt's python module (``lsm``) to provide some
basic information about HBA RAID volumes as properties of ``DiskDevice``.

DiskDevice.wwn
---------------
An attribute (``wwn``) has been added to ``DiskDevice`` to convey World Wide
Number for disks.

Removed
--------
* ``udev.device_is_realdisk``

Moved
------
Encrypted Volume Data has moved to a singleton and is no longer passed around
as arguments to ``DeviceTree`` or related classes.


2.1.3
======
* `Device Tags`

Device Tags
------------
All ``Device`` subclasses now have a ``tags`` attribute which is prepopulated
with predefined tags describing the drive(s) a device resides on. The available
tags are defined in ``blivet.devices.lib.Tags``.

2.1.2
======
* `Separate data/metadata LVs for thin/cache LVs`_

Separate data/metadata LVs for thin/cache LVs
----------------------------------------------
LVM thin pools and cached LVs can now be created from separate data/metadata LVs.


2.1.1
======
* `Improved handling for unsupported/corrupt disklabels`_

Improved handling for unsupported/corrupt disklabels
-----------------------------------------------------
Devices built on disklabels which are either corrupt or otherwise
not supported by parted are now correctly recognized and included
in the ``DeviceTree``. This means that users can now properly remove
all devices from such disks.


2.1.0
======
* `MD chunk size`

MD chunk size
--------------
Chunk size can now be specified when instantiating ``blivet.devices.MDRaidArrayDevice``.


2.0.0
======

* `PEP8 compatibility`_
* `LVM RAID`_
* `Thread safety`_
* `Handling of external storage events`_

* `API Stability`_
* `Removed`_
* `Moved`_


Removed
--------

The following were deprecated and have been removed.

* ``DeviceTree.get_devices_by_serial`` (use a list comprehension)

    For example, this::

        devs = devicetree.get_devices_by_serial(serial)

    could be accomplished like this::

        devs = [d for d in devicetree.devices if d.serial == serial]


* ``DeviceTree.get_devices_by_type`` (use a list comprehension)
* ``DeviceTree.get_devices_by_instance`` (use a list comprehension)
* ``BTRFSVolumeDevice.create_subvolumes``
* ``MDRaidArrayDevice.devices`` (use ``MDRaidArrayDevice.members``)
* ``MDBiosRaidArrayDevice.devices`` (use ``MDBiosRaidArrayDevice.members``)


Moved
------

* ``DeviceTree.register_action`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.add``)
* ``DeviceTree.cancel_action`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.remove``)
* ``DeviceTree.find_actions`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.find``)
* ``DeviceTree.prune_actions`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.prune``)
* ``DeviceTree.sort_actions`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.sort``)
* ``DeviceTree.process_actions`` (use ``DeviceTree.actions.process``)
* ``DeviceTree.get_children`` (use ``Device.children``)


API Stability
--------------

A complete public API specification can be found in the documentation,
which is available in the source tree at ``doc/api.rst`` and ``doc/api/``.

Beginning with version 2.0.0 the blivet project will be using semantic
versioning -- actually, we will be using a variation developed by the
OpenStack project which incorporates support for Python PEP440:
http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pbr/semver.html


LUKS resize
------------

Blivet now supports resize of block devices encrypted using LUKS, including
the ``Blivet.resize_device`` method.


Handling of external storage events
------------------------------------

Blivet now has the ability to listen for uevents on block devices and adjust to
externally-initiated changes. Event handling is not enabled by default. For an
example of how to enable this feature, see ``examples/uevents.py``. Most of the
code related to event handling is in the new ``blivet.events`` package. The
main pieces are ``blivet.events.manager.event_manager`` (an instance of
``blivet.events.manager.UdevEventManager``), ``blivet.events.manager.Event``,
and ``blivet.events.handler.EventHandlerMixin`` (a mixin class that augments
``DeviceTree``).


A single class for all LVs
---------------------------

In order to be better prepared for supporting things like *lvconvert*, Blivet
now represents all LVs with a single class (keeping the name
``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice``).


Using the class
++++++++++++++++

In order to create LVs of various types, different values of the ``seg_type``
parameter need to be passed. For example, to create a thin pool, ``thin-pool``
segment type needs to be specified (optionally together with the
thin-pool-specific parameters like ``metadata_size``) . The same applies to thin
LVs and the ``thin`` segment type. To create a snapshot LV, one needs to specify
the ``origin`` LV or set the ``vorigin`` flag to ``True``. Internal LVs require
``parent_lv`` and ``int_type`` specifying the type of the internal LV.

To determine the type of some LV, the newly added ``is_thin_lv``,
``is_thin_pool``, ``is_snapshot_lv`` and ``is_internal_lv`` properties can be
used.


Implementation details
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To avoid having a single gigantic class with hundreds of lines of code, the
``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice`` class makes use of iheritance and "merges" together
the ``LVMLogicalVolumeBase`` class and mixins for specific types of LVs (thin
pool, thin LV,...) adding the type-specific methods and properties as well as
type-specific implementations of various methods. The ``@type_specific``
decorator makes sure that the right implementation of a method is called
whenever there is a type-specific one (for example thin pools are created in a
different way than good old linear LVs).

The code that is common to all LVs lives in the ``LVMLogicalVolumeBase`` class
together with properties that are required by this code. Type-specific code
lives in the particular mixin classes and the generic/fallback implementations
live in the (ultimate) ``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice`` class' methods decorated with
the ``@type_specific`` decorator.


Devices know their children
----------------------------

Instances of ``blivet.device.Device`` now have a list of their direct
descendants: ``Device.children``. Accordingly, ``DeviceTree.get_children`` has
been removed.


Thread safety
--------------

Blivet now uses a global reentrant lock to ensure thread-safety within the
``Blivet``, ``DeviceTree``, ``Device``, and ``DeviceFormat`` classes.


LVM RAID
---------

Blivet now recognizes and supports creation of new non-linear LVs. The segment
type is properly reported in the ``seg_type`` attribute of the
``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice`` objects and the ``seg_type`` constructor parameter
can be used to create new LVs with specific segment types. Please note that only
the *linear* (default), *striped*, *mirror* and *raidX* segment types are
supported so far. Also the ``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice`` class now inherits from
the ``RaidDevice`` mixin.

Added properties:

* ``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice``

  - ``is_raid_lv``, ``mirrored``

  -  ``data_vg_space_used``, ``metadata_vg_space_used`` - space used by the
     data/metadata part of the LV in its VG taking the RAID level (i.e. the
     number of mirrors) into account

* ``LVMPhysicalVolume``

  - ``free`` - free space in the PV (for all existing and non-existing PVs)


Removed properties:

* ``LVMLogicalVolumeDevice``

  - ``copies``


Revamped code to populate the device tree
------------------------------------------

``blivet.populator.Populator`` has been rewritten to improve maintainability.
Most of the code that does type-specific handling for devices or formatting has
been moved into individual helper classes under ``blivet.populator.helpers``.
The populator class itself has been rewritten as a mixin
(``blivet.populator.PopulatorMixin``) that augments ``DeviceTree``.


PEP8 compatibility
-------------------

All code in blivet now conforms to
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. As a result, all non-class
names in the ``camelCase`` style have been renamed to the
``lower_case_with_underscores`` style. This applies to methods within classes,
but not to the names of the classes themselves -- they still use ``CamelCase``.


Changed Size implementation
---------------------------

The ``Size`` class now inherits from the ``bytesize.Size`` class provided by the
*libbytesize* library. There should be no difference in behaviour except for
potential speed-up and the ``human_readable()`` method having different
parameters. It now accepts the ``min_unit``, ``max_places`` and ``xlate``
parameters described in the documentation.
