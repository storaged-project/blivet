0. Thanks to the kernel patch submission guidelines, which were used as a
   framework for creating this document.

I. Source
=========

A) Obtain a current source tree.
If you do not have a repository with the current source handy, use git to obtain
one.  All installer-related projects can be found on the RH Installer project
page:

  http://github.com/rhinstaller/

In particular, the python-blivet repository can be found here:

  https://github.com/rhinstaller/blivet

Additional help for working within the codebase and testing changes can be found
on the Fedoraproject wiki:

II. Commits
===========
    - Considerations when composing your commit message
    - Special formatting (e.g. for RHEL patches)
    - Etiquette: when you should split a patch

A) Describe your changes clearly.
Describe your problem.  Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or 5000 lines
of a new feature, there must be an underlying problem that motivated you to do
this work.  Convince the reviewer that there is a problem worth fixing and that
it makes sense for them to read past the first paragraph.

Describe user-visible impact.  Straight up crashes and lockups are pretty
convincing, but not all bugs are that blatant.  Even if the problem was spotted
during code review, describe the impact you think it can have on users.

Once the problem is established, describe what you are actually doing about it
in technical detail.  It's important to describe the change in plain English for
the reviewer to verify that the code is behaving as you intend it to.

Solve only one problem per patch.  If your description starts to get long,
that's a sign that you probably need to split up your patch.

When you submit or resubmit a patch or patch series, include the complete patch
description and justification for it.  Don't just say that this is version N of
the patch (series).  Don't expect the reviewers to refer back to earlier patch
versions or referenced URLs to find the patch description and put that into the
patch.
In other words, the patch (series) and its description should be self-contained.

Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of
"[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz", as if
you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behaviour.

B) Special considerations for RHEL bugs.
If you are submitting a patch for any rhel-branch, the last line of your commit
message must identify the bugzilla bug # it fixes, using the "Resolves" or
"Related" keyword, e.g.:

    Resolves: rhbz#1111111
    or
    Related: rhbz#1234567

Use "Resolves" if the patch fixes the core issue which caused the bug.
Use "Related" if the patch fixes an ancillary issue that is related to, but
might not actually fix the bug.

C) Tracking other history in the commit log.
In order to easily reference various items related to any patch (set), other
information should be included in your commit message (after adequately
describing the problem and your fix). This includes:
    * GitHub issue, for easy reference back to any scheduled/task list items.
      Add a line(s):
        resolves #77
        or
        resolves rhinstaller/blivet#14

D) Separate your changes.
Separate each _logical change_ into a separate patch.

For example, if your changes include both bug fixes and new functionality in a
single area, separate those changes into two or more patches.  If your changes
include an API update, and new code which uses that new API, separate those into
two patches.

On the other hand, if you make a single change to numerous files, group those
changes into a single patch.  Thus a single logical change is contained within a
single patch.  The point to remember is that each patch should make an easily
understood change that can be verified by reviewers.

If one patch depends on another patch in order for a change to be complete, that
is OK.  Simply note "this patch depends on patch X" in your patch description.

When dividing your change into a series of patches, it is preferred that you
ensure that the project builds and runs properly after each patch in the series.
Developers using "git bisect" to track down a problem can end up splitting your
patch series at any point; they will not thank you if you introduce bugs in the
middle.

E) Style-check your changes.
Make sure that the style of your code matches that of the surrounding code.

F) Tests and sanity checking.
Prior to submitting any patch for review, make sure it runs through pylint
cleanly. The pylint test can be found in tests/pylint/runpylint.sh

Additionally, creating test files and making sure your changes pass new tests --
and do not break existing tests -- is crucial. Run "make test" to run the test
suite.


III. Submitting Patches
=======================
    - Acceptable formats for patch submission
    - Email guidelines
    - Pull Request guidelines
    - Bugzilla

A) Acceptable patch formats.
GitHub pull requests are accepted.  In fact, they are the preferred format.

Patches can also be sent to anaconda-patches@lists.fedorahosted.org, provided
they are formatted appropriately (see section III.C).

B) GitHub pull request guidelines
Labels are used extensively on pull requests in GitHub. Labels make it very easy
to visually filter a list of pull requests. Labels that we use include:
    * rhelX-branch -- Any RHEL pull requests should be tagged with the
      appropriate RHEL branch label (e.g. rhel6-branch, rhel7-branch)
    * fXY-branch -- Any Fedora pull requests should be tagged with the
      appropriate Fedora branch label (e.g. f22-branch)
    * Python 3 check -- If a pull request introduces changes which need to be
      verified as Python 3 compatible, set this label. (Or someone who reviews
      your pull request might set this.)
    * ACK -- Once somebody has reviewed your pull request, they will set the ACK
      label if your patch is approved.
    * NACK -- If somebody has reviewed your pull request and disapproves with
      the patch, they will set the NACK label.

If submitting a patch against multiple branches (e.g. master, rhel7-branch),
submit the original pull request against master branch. Use labels to tag the
request for each branch it is intended for.

After approval, merge your commit to master branch. You will have to manually
cherry pick it to any other branches. Use "git cherry-pick -x $commit" to do
this, so there is a reference back to the original commit.

C) Email guidelines.
    i. What to include in your subjects.
    It is common convention to prefix your subject line with
    [$project][$branches].  This makes it clear which project the patches are
    for and which branches the patches are intended for.

    This also applies to lone patches that do not include a cover letter.
    Examples:
      Subject: [blivet][master] Move the Blivet class into its own module
      Subject: [blivet][master/rhel7-branch] Do not unhide devices with hidden
               parents (#1158643)

    It is common convention to prefix patch subject lines with [PATCH].  This
    makes clear that the message is a patch.

    ii. No MIME, no links, no compression, no attachments.  Just plain text.
    The developers need to be able to read and comment on the changes you are
    submitting.  It is important for a developer to be able to "quote" your
    changes, using standard e-mail tools, so that they may comment on specific
    portions of your code.

    For this reason, all patches should be submitting e-mail "inline".  WARNING:
    Be wary of your editor's word-wrap corrupting your patch, if you choose to
    cut-n-paste your patch.

    Do not attach the patch as a MIME attachment, compressed or not.

    Use "git send-email" to post your patch to the list. Git send-email is a
    nice, command line utility that makes it easy to send a patch or patch set
    to a mailing list.

    iii. E-mail size.
    Large changes are not appropriate for mailing listss.  If your patch,
    uncompressed, exceeds 300 kB in size, it is preferred that you store your
    patch on a server and provide instead a URL (link) pointing to your patch.
    But note that if your patch exceeds 300 kB, it almost certainly needs to be
    broken up anyway.

    iv. Canonical patch format.
    This section describes how the patch itself should be formatted.  Note that,
    if you have your patches are stored in a git repository, proper patch
    formatting can be had with "git format-patch".  The tools cannot create the
    necessary text, though, so read the instructions anyway.

    Cover letter subject should include the component, the relevant branches,
    and the relevant bugzilla bug # (if applicable).

    Some examples of the canonical patch subject line:
        Subject: [PATCH 1/4][blivet][f22-branch] summary phrase (#9999999)
        Subject: [PATCH 1/3][blivet][master] Split X out of class Y into new
                 class Z

    The canonical patch message body contains the following:
      - A "from" line specifying the patch's original author.
      - An empty line.
      - The body of the explanation, which will be copied to the permanent
        changelog to describe this patch.
      - A marker line containing simply "---".
      - Any additional comments not suitable for the changelog.
      - The actual patch (diff output).

    The "summary phrase" in the email's Subject should concisely describe the
    patch which the email contains in no more than 70-75 characters.  The
    "summary phrase" should not be a filename.  Do not use the same "summary
    phrase" for every patch in a whole patch series (where a "patch series" is
    an ordered sequence of multiple, related patches).  Bear in mind that the
    "summary phrase" of your email will be the only thing that people may
    quickly see when they are scanning through patches.

    Tags enclosed in square brackets are not considered part of the "summary
    phrase", but describe how the patch should be treated.  Common tags might
    include the patch number/total, e.g. if there are four patches in a series,
    they may be numbered like this: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4.

    The "from" line must be the very first line in the message body, and has the
    form:
        From: Original Author <author@example.com>

    The "from" line specifies who will be credited as the author of the patch in
    the permanent changelog.  If the "from" line is missing, then the "From:"
    line from the email header will be used to determine the patch author in the
    changelog.

    Special note to back-porters: It is generally useful when cherry-picking a
    commit from master onto another branch to use the -x option. This option
    tells git to insert a note indicating the original commit id, and is often
    useful.

D) Bugzilla
Once submitting a pull request, if there is an associated bug # in bugzilla,
please set the status of the bug to POST, and add a comment with a link to your
pull request.


IV. The review process
======================
    - What to expect, and when.
    - Behavioral conduct.

A) Respond to review comments.
Your patch will almost certainly get comments from reviewers on ways in which
the patch can be improved.  You must respond to those comments; ignoring
reviewers is a good way to get ignored in return.  Comments or questions that do
not result in a code change should almost certainly bring about a comment or
changelog entry so that the next reviewer better understands what is going on.

Be sure to tell the reviewers what changes you are making and to thank them for
their time.  Code review is a tiring and time-consuming  process, and reviewers
sometimes get grumpy.  Even in that case, though, respond politely and address
the problems they have pointed out.

It is important to understand that patches must sometimes go through several
iterations of review before being approved.  Not all patches will be accepted
either.  It is important that you do not take any criticism personally.  Patch
review is an objective and rational critique only of the content of the patch
itself.

B) Don't get discouraged - or impatient.
After you have submitted your change, be patient and wait.  Reviewers are busy
people and may not get to your patch right away.

You should receive comments within a week or so; if that does not happen, make
sure that you have sent your patches to the right place.  Wait for a  minimum of
one week before resubmitting or pinging reviewers - possibly  longer during busy
times like Fedora release stabilization.

Note that there is a minimum review period of 24 hours for any patch.  The
purpose of this rule is to ensure that all interested parties have an
opportunity to review every patch.  When posting a patch before or after a
holiday break it is important to extend this period as appropriate.
