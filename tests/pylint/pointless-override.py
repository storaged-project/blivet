class PointlessClassAttributeOverrideChecker(BaseChecker):
    """ If the nearest definition of the class attribute in the MRO assigns
        it the same value, then the overriding definition is said to be
        pointless.

        The algorithm for detecting a pointless attribute override is the following.

        * For each class, C:
           - For each attribute assignment,
               name_1 = name_2 ... name_n = l (where l is a literal):
              * For each n in (n_1, n_2):
                - Traverse the linearization of the MRO until the first
                   matching assignment n = l' is identified. If l is equal to l',
                   then consider that the assignment to l in C is a
                   pointless override.

        The algorithm for detecting a pointless method override has the same
        general structure, and the same defects discussed below.

        Note that this analysis is neither sound nor complete. It is unsound
        under multiple inheritance. Consider the following class hierarchy::

            class A(object):
                _attrib = False

            class B(A):
                _attrib = False

            class C(A):
                _attrib = True

            class D(B,C):
                pass

        In this  case, starting from B, B._attrib = False would be considered
        pointless. However, for D the MRO is B, C, A, and removing the assignment
        B._attrib = False would change the inherited value of D._attrib from
        False to True.

        The analysis is incomplete because it will find some values unequal when
        actually they are equal.

        The analysis is both incomplete and unsound because it expects that
        assignments will always be made by means of the same syntax.
